                Non-Western entrepreneurs assert that DeepSeek exemplifies the notion that innovation does not necessarily require billions of dollars in investment. The Chinese application has reportedly "blown the roof off" expectations and "shifted the power dynamics" within the industry.
            </p>
            
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                In a controversial statement made during his 2023 visit to India, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman remarked that it was "hopeless" for a young team with less than $10 million to compete with his company in the realm of training foundational large language models. However, a year and a half later, a Chinese startup seems to have challenged that assertion.

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                "This marks the next inflection point in AI following ChatGPT," noted Aakrit Vaish, founder of Haptik, one of the world's leading conversational AI enterprises and an advisor to India's government on AI initiatives.
            </p>
            
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                On January 20, DeepSeek, a startup founded just two years prior, introduced an artificial intelligence model that it claims to have trained with an investment of less than $6 million. Within a week of its launch, the chatbot application soared to the top of Apple's App Store and Google Play store rankings in the United States. According to an independent AI quality index, DeepSeek's model performs comparably to other well-known AI models.
            </p>
            
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                In contrast, OpenAI has amassed nearly $18 billion in funding to date, with Altman stating in April 2023 that the company had expended over $100 million solely on the training of its latest model, GPT-4.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                Reactions to DeepSeek's emergence in Western circles have ranged from enthusiasm and astonishment to skepticism regarding the authenticity of its low-cost claims, along with concerns about data clarity, security vulnerabilities, and allegations of intellectual property theft. Nevertheless, the AI sectors in Asia and Africa are celebrating DeepSeek not just for its achievements but for what it symbolizes: a testament to the possibility of combining frugality with innovation.
                
                Vaish emphasized that DeepSeek's success in developing a faster and more cost-effective AI model, as outlined in its research paper, opens the door for more teams to engage in AI development without the necessity of conducting foundational research.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                The launch of DeepSeek's latest model had significant repercussions in the U.S. stock markets. On January 27, shares of American chipmaker Nvidia plummeted by 17%, marking the largest single-day loss in U.S. history, following DeepSeek's announcement that it had constructed its model using Nvidia's less advanced H800 chips and only 2,788 GPUs, in stark contrast to the 10,000 GPUs utilized by OpenAI.
                
                "DeepSeek has fundamentally altered the landscape by demonstrating that there are multiple avenues to achieve success, thereby shifting the power dynamics," stated Oswald Osaretin Guobadia, founder and CEO of the policy advisory firm DigitA and a senior special assistant to Nigeria's former president, Muhammadu Buhari.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                Guobadia further remarked, "This should serve as motivation for us in Nigeria to reform our governmental and programmatic structures. Africa, as a whole, should strive for a collaborative and coordinated effort, much like China has achieved through its consolidated approach."
                
                Karim Beguir, co-founder and CEO of InstaDeep, one of Africa's foremost AI startups, described DeepSeek as "an example of clever engineering." However, he cautioned that Africa requires a greater supply of GPUs for its startups to compete on a global scale, noting that the continent currently possesses less than 0.1% of the world’s GPUs.
                
                On January 27, the threat intelligence firm Kela reported several security vulnerabilities within DeepSeek's model. Later that week, Microsoft, the parent company of OpenAI, began investigating claims that DeepSeek had appropriated intellectual property from its AI competitor. In the midst of its rising global popularity, the app faced restrictions in Ireland and Italy due to data privacy concerns.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                While DeepSeek disclosed certain details about its model in its research paper, Stanford professor Percy Liang highlighted a lack of transparency, stating, "There’s no training or data processing code, and hardly any information about the data."
                
                "InstaDeep’s Beguir acknowledged that while DeepSeek may not be the leading model available, it represents a significant advancement in the approach to training AI models, which could simplify the development process for others. However, he expressed uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the budget claims made by DeepSeek.

            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                Vaish concurred, emphasizing the necessity for greater transparency regarding DeepSeek’s models, stating, "There are many undisclosed elements, and details about the individuals behind the project remain somewhat enigmatic." Despite ongoing debates about DeepSeek's reported cost efficiencies, Vaish suggested that the actual expenses might not be as inflated as some speculate, asserting, "At worst, it may be 10, 15, or 20 times the claimed budget, but that would still not amount to $1 billion."
                
                In 2024, research firm Pitchbook reported that AI and machine learning startups secured one-third of total global venture capital funding. Nonetheless, apprehensions persist that excessive investments are directed toward foundational models and infrastructure, while insufficient attention is given to the practical applications of AI.
                
                To accelerate industry progress, Vaish argued that it is crucial for companies not to start from scratch. "We never built the internet browser or the cloud infrastructure that supports global data operations. So why should we suddenly insist on developing AI infrastructure?" he questioned, referencing India. "In scenarios where technology becomes commoditized and accessible to all, that is when India excels, and this moment represents our opportunity."
