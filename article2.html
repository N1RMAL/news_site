                Elon Musk has come out as one of the most famous and important and (something that causes arguments between people) figures within the new Trump management. He spent at least US$277 million (around A$360 million) of his own wealth to support Donald Trump's re-election (series of actions to reach a goal), travelling across the country next to him. This big (related to managing money) and time investment raises the question of what Musk, the world's richest individual, expects to gain in return.

                Experts views from Explore More Elon Musk and Donald Trump Elon Musk and Donald Trump People (who say bad things or give opinions) have guessed whether Musk's support of Trump is a plain/honest/easy commercial arrangement, with Musk expecting/looking ahead to political favours, or if it reflects Musk's personal political beliefs and possible political desires to do great things.
            </p>
            
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
                From Left to Alt-Right Musk's political views are complex and very hard to pin down, mostly by design. His current feed on X presents a confusing mix of far-right (beliefs that people secretly work together to control or harm others) on (entering into a country), clips from neoliberal money-flow expert Milton Friedman warning about inflation, and advertisements for Tesla. (in the past), Musk described himself as a left libertarian, stating that he voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Joe Biden in 2020.
            </p>
            
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                However, Musk claims that the Democratic Party has shifted further left over time, which has led him to feel more matched up with/even with the Republican Party. Advertisement A key factor in Musk's political shift, according to his own account, is his (separation due to anger, OR very sad feelings of separation) from his (related to not identifying with the sex you were at birth) daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson. After her change (from one thing to another), Musk (in a way that causes arguments between people) claimed that she was "dead, killed by the woke mind virus", though she is very much alive. Since then, he has over and over again argued/against (related to not identifying with the sex you were at birth) rights, (male/female status)-promising/stating as true care, and (many different kinds of people or things), equity, and including in something policies.
            </p>
            
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                However, Musk's political shift can better be understood as part of a wider movement known as the "libertarian to alt-right pipeline". Rather than being driven only by changes within the Democratic Party, Musk's politics seem to be a reflection of a wider (popular thing/general way things are going) in the libertarian movement, which has more and more matched up with/even with far-right beliefs. Libertarianism usually/(in the past) includes both left-leaning and right-leaning thin pieces/strings.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                Left libertarians support limited government and money-based (removal of controlling laws) while fighting for progressive social policies like marriage (state where all things are equal) and drug decriminalisation. Right libertarians share the same money-based views but hold conservative social (ways of standing/ways of thinking), such as opposite (or fighting against) (pregnancy ended before birth) rights and celebrating (believing that your country is the best). Over the last few years, libertarianism in the United States has leaned more to the right, with many libertarians actively participating in the alt-right movement, which argues (against) (including people of different backgrounds)ism, treating men and women equally, and (many different kinds of people or things), and supports white (believing that your country is the best). 
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                The alt-right is an internet-driven movement, often using trolling and (something that causes arguments between people) content to cause/start extreme anger and attract attention. Making Sense of Musk Musk's values match up/make even with limited-government libertarianism in money-based terms. He fights for/fighters for reducing government spending, lowering taxes, and undoing/reversing rules-especially those that affect his businesses. His formal role in the Trump management as head of the "Department of Government (wasting very little while working or producing something)", or DOGE, is meant to advance these goals.

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                Musk has suggested that, as part of his government (wasting very little while working or producing something) efforts, he will focus on cutting (many different kinds of people or things), equity, and including in something (DEI) attempts (to begin something new), reflecting alt-right influences. On X, Musk has also engaged with white (people who believe that their country is the best) and (helped increase/showed in a good way) racist (beliefs that people secretly work together to control or harm others), such as the "Great Replacement" explanation (of why something works or happens the way it does) and the "Muslim (making you look good) gangs" plan (that was put together secretly by a group of people).

            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                Whether Musk really/honestly believes these secret agreements (to commit crime) is secondary; his online behaviour seems to be part of a deliberate alt-right (related to what regular, ordinary people like and want) (success plan(s)/way(s) of reaching goals) designed to cause/start (anger), upset the left, and then claim victimhood when criticised. Explanation (of why something works or happens the way it does) vs Practice While Musk's public statements match up/make even with libertarian thinking, there are disagreements between things when it comes to putting these ideas into practice. (even though there is the existence of) fighting for limited government, Musk's companies have gotten good things from significant government helping payments and support. Musk also argues (against) (entering into a country) but has argued for the continuation of H1-B skilled worker visas, a move that has angered some people (who believe that white people are better than others). 

            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
                These visas allow (only lasting for a short time) workers to enter the US for up to six years and are often used in the tech part/area, benefiting companies like those owned by Musk and Trump. An Unsteady Friendly partnership What can we expect from Musk now that he holds political office and holds influence? His goal of cutting $2 trillion from the US budget seems unlikely, but he is likely to focus on creating (argument-causing event/arguments between people) by cutting DEI attempts (to begin something new) and other politically sensitive programs, such as support for women's (rights of people to have children as they choose). Musk will definitely use his political position to serve the interests of his companies. Following Trump's re-election, shares in Tesla suddenly rushed/increased, signalling that (people or businesses who give money to help start businesses) expect Musk to benefit (related to money) from the second Trump management. Musk will also continue to take advantage of his public influence, which may lead to conflicts with Trump himself. He has already fallen out with Vivek Ramaswamy, who will no longer co-lead DOGE with Musk. If the friendly partnership between Trump and Musk (continues to exist/continues to do hard or annoying things), it will likely play an extremely important role in the rise of a "new gold-covered/showy age" seen as political (dishonest actions that ruin your trust) and growing (state where two things are not the same).
